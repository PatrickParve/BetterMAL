# navigation-and-search Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change bootstrap-anime-tracker. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Navbar layout
The system SHALL provide a navbar whose left buttons are, in order, Home, My List, Top, Season, and Airing, and right controls Profile, the hide/unhide MAL-score toggle, and a Settings (gear icon) button.

#### Scenario: Navigating via the navbar
- **WHEN** I click a navbar button
- **THEN** I am taken to the corresponding page (Home, My List, Top, Season, Airing, Profile, or Settings)

#### Scenario: My List is reachable from the navbar
- **WHEN** the navbar renders
- **THEN** a "My List" button appears in the left button group and navigates to the my-list page

#### Scenario: Opening settings from the gear
- **WHEN** I click the Settings gear icon
- **THEN** I am taken to the settings page

### Requirement: Clickable anime cards everywhere
The system SHALL make anime cards clickable everywhere they appear, linking to that anime's detail page.

#### Scenario: Clicking any card
- **WHEN** I click an anime card on any page
- **THEN** I am taken to that anime's detail page

### Requirement: English title preferred for display
The system SHALL, wherever an anime title is displayed (Home, Season, Top, anime detail, Profile, My List, Airing, and search results), show the anime's English title when one is available, falling back to the default title otherwise.

#### Scenario: English title available
- **WHEN** an anime has a stored English title and its title is displayed anywhere
- **THEN** the English title is shown

#### Scenario: No English title
- **WHEN** an anime has no English title
- **THEN** the default title is shown

### Requirement: Type-ahead search, merged local + live ranked by prefix and popularity
The system SHALL provide a centered, debounced type-ahead search that, on every query, MERGES matches from the local cache with a live MAL search (deduplicated by anime id) rather than short-circuiting on cached matches. It SHALL rank titles whose title or English title STARTS WITH the query ahead of titles that merely CONTAIN the query, order each group by popularity — most popular first, with unranked titles (MAL popularity rank absent or zero) last — and show a dropdown of up to 5 matches with picture and title. A live-search failure SHALL degrade to local matches only rather than erroring. When the query is wrapped in double quotes (`"…"`), the system SHALL instead return only anime whose title or English title EXACTLY equals the quoted text.

#### Scenario: Prefix matches ranked by popularity
- **WHEN** I type a query that is the start of several anime titles
- **THEN** the dropdown shows up to 5 matches, listing titles that start with the query first, ordered by popularity (e.g. typing "attack" surfaces the popular "Attack on Titan" entries, not a single incidental cached title)

#### Scenario: Contains-matches fill remaining slots
- **WHEN** fewer than 5 anime titles start with the query
- **THEN** anime whose title contains the query (but does not start with it) fill the remaining slots, also ordered by popularity

#### Scenario: Uncached titles found via live search
- **WHEN** a matching anime is not in the local cache
- **THEN** it still appears because the live MAL search results are merged in (e.g. searching "paradise" surfaces "Hell's Paradise")

#### Scenario: Exact match with quotes
- **WHEN** I wrap the query in double quotes
- **THEN** only anime whose title or English title exactly equals the quoted text are shown

#### Scenario: Live-search failure is non-fatal
- **WHEN** the live MAL search fails (network blip or transient error)
- **THEN** the dropdown still shows any local-cache matches instead of erroring

### Requirement: Full search results page
The system SHALL provide a dedicated search results page that lists every anime matching a submitted query, presented the same way as the seasonal page (picture, title, media type, and episode count per card). Results SHALL default to the order returned by the search API (closest match first) and SHALL additionally be sortable by Popularity, MAL score, Alphabetical, and My score; the Popularity sort SHALL place unranked anime (MAL popularity rank absent or zero) last. The page SHALL show at most 50 results per page with pagination controls. A double-quoted query SHALL constrain results to exact title matches. The query, sort, and page SHALL be held in the URL so back-navigation restores the same view.

#### Scenario: Viewing full results for a query
- **WHEN** I submit a search
- **THEN** the search page shows all matching anime as cards with picture, title, type, and episode count, in the API's relevance order by default

#### Scenario: Sorting results
- **WHEN** I choose a sort option on the search page
- **THEN** the results reorder by Relevance, Popularity, MAL score, Alphabetical, or My score as selected

#### Scenario: Paginating results
- **WHEN** a query returns more than 50 matches
- **THEN** results are split into pages of 50 with pagination controls to move between them

#### Scenario: Exact match on the results page
- **WHEN** I submit a double-quoted query
- **THEN** the results page lists only anime whose title or English title exactly equals the quoted text

#### Scenario: View restored on back-navigation
- **WHEN** I open an anime from the results and navigate back
- **THEN** the same query, sort, and page are restored from the URL

### Requirement: Search submission keeps the query text
The system SHALL let the user submit the current search either by pressing Enter in the search box or by clicking a magnifier button beside it, navigating to the search results page for that query. The submitted text SHALL remain in the search box (and SHALL be restored from the URL when the search page is loaded directly or reloaded) rather than being cleared.

#### Scenario: Submit via Enter
- **WHEN** I press Enter with text in the search box
- **THEN** I am taken to the search results page for that query and the text stays in the box

#### Scenario: Submit via the magnifier button
- **WHEN** I click the magnifier button beside the search box
- **THEN** I am taken to the search results page for the current query

#### Scenario: Query restored on the search page
- **WHEN** I load or reload the search page for a query (e.g. via a direct `/search?q=…` link)
- **THEN** the search box shows that query
