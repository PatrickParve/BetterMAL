## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Series stats
The series page SHALL show, for the main line: total episode count, total runtime, and my progress through it — episodes watched against total, entries completed against total, time watched, and time left to finish. Extras' episode count and runtime SHALL be reported separately rather than folded into the main-line totals.

Runtime SHALL be computed as episodes times the entry's average episode duration, falling back to the app's existing 24-minutes-per-episode assumption when a duration is unknown, and SHALL be formatted in days, hours and minutes (e.g. `4d 6h 30min`). When any counted entry's episode count is unknown, the page SHALL mark the total as a lower bound rather than presenting it as exact. An entry whose total episode count is unknown SHALL still contribute its known aired-so-far episode count toward that lower bound, rather than contributing nothing, whenever an aired count is known for it — so a still-airing entry with no announced total makes the lower bound tighter instead of forcing the whole stat to read as wholly unknown. Watched time SHALL count watched episodes only and SHALL NOT multiply by rewatch count.

While any member of the series is currently airing, my progress SHALL be shown with the same broadcast-progress bar the home page uses — episodes aired so far as the primary fill, my watched episodes layered on top of it — so it is visible how much of what has aired I have seen. When no member is airing, my progress SHALL use the plain watched-against-total bar, since aired and total are then the same figure.

The progress figures SHALL be named rather than left to be inferred from a bare `x/y` label: the page SHALL state my watched episode count, the episodes aired so far, and the main-line total as three separately named figures, each keyed to the colour of the fill it describes. The aired figure SHALL be shown only while a member of the series is currently airing, since it is otherwise the same number as the total, and the total SHALL carry its lower-bound marker here exactly as it does in the episode total.

Episodes aired SHALL be summed over exactly those main-line entries whose total episode count is known, counting an entry that has finished airing as its full total, a currently airing entry as the episodes it has aired so far, and an entry that has not yet aired as none — so the aired figure can never exceed the total the page shows.

The page SHALL additionally show the highest MAL-scored entry, my highest-scored entry, and the studios and genres the series spans.

The page SHALL additionally show which entry or entries are tied for the most rewatches across the series (main line and extras alike), naming each tied entry and its rewatch count. This stat SHALL NOT be shown at all when no member of the series has been rewatched, rather than showing a stat naming zero-rewatch entries.

Where several entries tie for the highest MAL score, for my highest score, or for the most rewatches, the page SHALL list every tied entry rather than picking one. Tied highest-MAL entries and tied most-rewatched entries SHALL be listed in watch order. Tied favourites SHALL be listed in my saved favourite order, with entries I have not ordered following in watch order.

The highest MAL score SHALL be shown in full rather than blurred when the entry holding it is one I have both completed and scored, since I already know that score. Until then, the page SHALL withhold that entry's title and link entirely — not only its score — so an unwatched entry is never named by this stat; this withholding applies regardless of the hide-scores toggle's own state, since it protects against spoiling which entry is best rather than against exposing a score value.

#### Scenario: Runtime of the main series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main line totals 62 episodes averaging 24 minutes
- **THEN** the page shows the main-line episode total and a runtime of "1d 0h 48min"

#### Scenario: Extras counted separately
- **WHEN** a series has 5 specials beyond its main line
- **THEN** their episode count and runtime appear as their own figures, not inside the main-line totals

#### Scenario: Unknown episode counts are marked
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with an unpublished total episode count
- **THEN** the runtime total is presented as a lower bound rather than an exact figure

#### Scenario: An unpublished total still counts what has aired
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with no published total episode count but 1,100 episodes are known to have aired for it
- **THEN** the main-line episode total includes those 1,100 aired episodes rather than contributing zero for that entry, and the total is still marked as a lower bound

#### Scenario: My progress through the series
- **WHEN** I have watched 38 of a series' 62 main-line episodes and nothing is airing
- **THEN** the page shows a progress bar with my 38 watched episodes and the 62 total each named, how many entries I have completed, my time watched, and the time left to finish

#### Scenario: Broadcast progress while a season is airing
- **WHEN** a series' latest season is currently airing, 12 of its episodes have aired, and earlier seasons total 50 episodes
- **THEN** my progress shows a bar whose aired fill covers 62 episodes with my watched episodes layered on top of it, and the watched, aired, and total figures are each named beside it

#### Scenario: The aired figure is only shown while something is airing
- **WHEN** I open a series where no member is currently airing
- **THEN** the progress readout names my watched count and the total, and does not repeat the total as a separate aired figure

#### Scenario: Tied highest MAL scores list every entry
- **WHEN** two seasons of a series share the same highest MAL score
- **THEN** both are listed under the highest MAL score, in watch order

#### Scenario: Highest MAL score of a completed entry is not blurred
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on and the highest-MAL-scored entry is one I have completed and scored
- **THEN** its MAL score is shown in full

#### Scenario: An unwatched entry's title is withheld from Highest MAL score
- **WHEN** the entry holding the series' highest MAL score is not one I have both completed and scored
- **THEN** the page shows no title or link for that entry in the Highest MAL score stat, regardless of whether the hide-scores toggle is on or off

#### Scenario: Tied favourites list every entry
- **WHEN** I have given the same highest score to three entries of a series
- **THEN** all three are listed as my favourite

#### Scenario: Most rewatched entry is shown
- **WHEN** one entry in a series has a rewatch count of 3 and no other member has a higher rewatch count
- **THEN** the page shows a "Most rewatched" stat naming that entry and its count of 3

#### Scenario: Tied most-rewatched entries list every entry
- **WHEN** two entries in a series share the same highest rewatch count
- **THEN** both are listed under "Most rewatched", in watch order

#### Scenario: No rewatch stat when nothing has been rewatched
- **WHEN** no member of a series has a rewatch count above zero
- **THEN** the page shows no "Most rewatched" stat at all

### Requirement: Series timeline ribbon
The series page SHALL present the main line as one chronological list of cards, one per entry, in watch order — including an entry with no air date yet, such as an announced but unscheduled next season, shown inline in its correct sequence position rather than set apart from the dated entries around it. This section SHALL be the page's only presentation of the main line — there SHALL NOT be a separate, non-chronological list of main-line entries elsewhere on the page.

Every card SHALL be the same fixed size regardless of how long that entry ran, and every pair of adjacent cards SHALL be separated by the same fixed spacing regardless of how long the real wait between them was — a variable-width, aspect-ratio-locked poster reads as inconsistent image sizing rather than as a duration or gap signal, so neither a card's width nor the space around it varies with real elapsed time.

A year ruler SHALL run above the cards, scrolling together with them so a year's label stays aligned with the card it belongs to. The ruler SHALL label only a year in which some main-line entry actually aired; a year that falls entirely between two entries, with nothing airing, SHALL NOT be labelled, so the ruler never implies activity that did not happen. Each labelled year SHALL be positioned at the point on its own card where that year begins, so a season that itself spans several calendar years shows a label for each of those years across its own card, and a year whose boundary falls right as one season ends and the next begins is attributed to the earlier season's card rather than being duplicated or stranded between them. When no main-line entry has an air date, the ruler SHALL be omitted entirely.

Each card SHALL show its picture, title, media type, year (or an explicit no-date indicator for an entry with none), episode count, my list status, and SHALL link to that anime's detail page and offer an edit control that opens the app's shared entry editor. A card's title SHALL reserve the same vertical space regardless of whether it wraps to one line or two, so a short title does not throw the rest of that card's layout out of alignment with its row neighbours. A card for a currently-airing entry SHALL carry a distinct "airing" indicator rather than restating in text how many episodes have broadcast so far, since that count is already shown as a graphical fill on the card. A card for an entry I have started but not completed SHALL additionally state my watched episode count against that entry's total. A card SHALL show its entry's rewatch count when it is greater than zero.

Each card SHALL be filled to show how much of that entry I have watched, and SHALL show broadcast progress behind my own fill while that entry is airing.

Each card SHALL carry a paired score readout — MAL's score for that entry and mine — rendered as numeric values in the same colour convention and visual treatment the More section's tiles already use for their score chips (blue for MAL, purple for mine), rather than as an independently height-scaled graphical bar per entry. The MAL side SHALL follow the same hide-scores behaviour as every other MAL score on the page — blurred with a reveal control while the hide-scores toggle is on, shown in full when the entry is one I have completed and scored and the "always show completed scores" setting is on; my own score SHALL always be shown.

Main-line entries with no air date SHALL be shown in their correct watch-order position among the dated cards rather than set apart in their own lane, carrying an explicit no-date indicator so it reads unambiguously as dateless rather than as a dated card with missing information.

The timeline SHALL scroll within its own container when it does not fit, rather than making the page scroll sideways.

#### Scenario: Main line in watch order
- **WHEN** I open a series with four main-line entries
- **THEN** they are shown in watch order on the timeline, each the same size, showing its picture, title, type, year, episodes, MAL score, my score, and my status

#### Scenario: Cards are the same size and evenly spaced regardless of duration
- **WHEN** a series has one entry that ran for a single cour and another that ran continuously for several years
- **THEN** both cards render at the same size, and the spacing between every pair of cards on the timeline is the same

#### Scenario: A year with nothing airing is not labelled
- **WHEN** a series has a two-year stretch with nothing airing between two seasons
- **THEN** neither of those two years appears on the year ruler

#### Scenario: A year is attributed to the season that was airing
- **WHEN** one season ends and the next begins within the same calendar year
- **THEN** that year's label appears once, on the earlier season's card

#### Scenario: An airing card is marked rather than captioned
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing
- **THEN** its card carries an airing indicator, and its episode count reads as its total rather than restating in text how many have broadcast so far

#### Scenario: A partly-watched card states my position
- **WHEN** I have watched 5 episodes of a 24-episode entry and have not completed it
- **THEN** its card states my 5 against that entry's 24

#### Scenario: My progress on each card
- **WHEN** I have completed the first season, watched half the second, and not started the third
- **THEN** the first card is fully filled, the second half filled, and the third empty

#### Scenario: Scores shown the same way as the More section
- **WHEN** I open a series where MAL rates the third season lowest and I rate it highest
- **THEN** that card shows both scores as numeric chips in the app's blue-for-MAL/purple-for-mine convention, the same treatment the More section's tiles use

#### Scenario: A MAL score hides and reveals like everywhere else
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on and a card's entry is not one I have completed and scored
- **THEN** that card's MAL chip is blurred with a reveal control, the same as a MAL score anywhere else on the page

#### Scenario: An unreleased next season is shown in sequence
- **WHEN** a main-line entry has been announced with no air date yet
- **THEN** its card appears in its correct watch-order position among the dated cards, carrying a no-date indicator, rather than being set apart from them

#### Scenario: A rewatched main-line entry shows its count
- **WHEN** a main-line entry has a rewatch count of 2
- **THEN** its card shows a rewatch indicator reading 2

### Requirement: Main series and More sections
The main line's presentation SHALL be governed by the Series timeline ribbon requirement, not by this one; this requirement governs only the More section, where extras SHALL be presented as poster tiles grouped by media type, so the extras read as a different kind of thing from the chronological main line.

Each tile SHALL carry the information a main-line card carries — picture, title, year, episode count, MAL score, my score, and my list status, with the media type carried by its group heading — SHALL link to that anime's detail page, SHALL offer the same edit control, and SHALL show its entry's rewatch count when it is greater than zero. As on a main-line card, a tile's title SHALL reserve the same vertical space regardless of line count, so tiles in the same row stay aligned.

Each More group SHALL show its entry count in its heading. When a series has more than twelve extras every group SHALL start collapsed, and otherwise every group SHALL start expanded.

Each More group SHALL be collapsible, and the section SHALL offer one control that expands or collapses every group at once — unless every extra in the series is already marked Completed in my list, in which case no group offers a collapse/expand control, every group SHALL always render fully expanded, and the one-control affordance SHALL NOT be offered at all, since there is nothing left worth hiding.

That one control, when offered, SHALL read "Expand all"/"Collapse all" when the series has more than one More group, and SHALL read "Expand"/"Collapse" without the word "all" when it has exactly one group, since "all" is meaningless applied to a single category.

A collapsed group SHALL NOT render its tiles, so a franchise with many extras cannot make the page arbitrarily long.

An edit saved from a tile SHALL update it in place without reloading the page.

#### Scenario: Extras grouped in More
- **WHEN** a series has two specials, one OVA, and a music video
- **THEN** the More section shows them as poster tiles under a collapsible group per media type, each heading carrying its count

#### Scenario: A large More section starts collapsed
- **WHEN** I open a series with twenty extras
- **THEN** every More group starts collapsed, no tiles are rendered, and one control expands them all

#### Scenario: A small More section starts open
- **WHEN** I open a series with four extras
- **THEN** their groups start expanded

#### Scenario: Editing from a tile
- **WHEN** I use a tile's edit control and save a new score
- **THEN** the same entry editor used elsewhere in the app opens, and the tile and the series stats reflect the new score without a page reload

#### Scenario: A series with no extras
- **WHEN** every member of a series is main line
- **THEN** the More section is not shown

#### Scenario: Collapse control suppressed once everything is watched
- **WHEN** every extra in a series is marked Completed in my list
- **THEN** every More group renders fully expanded with no per-group toggle and no all-groups control

#### Scenario: Singular wording for one extras category
- **WHEN** a series has extras in only one media-type group and at least one is not Completed
- **THEN** the all-groups control reads "Expand" or "Collapse" without the word "all"

#### Scenario: Plural wording for more than one extras category
- **WHEN** a series has extras across two or more media-type groups and at least one extra is not Completed
- **THEN** the all-groups control reads "Expand all" or "Collapse all"

#### Scenario: A rewatched extra shows its count
- **WHEN** an extra has a rewatch count of 1
- **THEN** its tile shows a rewatch indicator reading 1
