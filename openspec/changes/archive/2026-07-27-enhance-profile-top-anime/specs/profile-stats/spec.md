## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: My top anime with minimum-of-ten fill and manual selection
The system SHALL show my top anime, always showing at least 10 when I have scored at least 10 anime. The list SHALL be ordered by score descending and grouped into score tiers: a lower-scored anime SHALL NEVER appear above a higher-scored one. It SHALL include all anime I scored 10; if there are 10 or more such anime it shows all of them with no cap. If there are fewer than 10, it SHALL fill the remainder up to 10 from the next-highest score tiers in descending score order; the tier that does not fully fit SHALL be truncated so the list stops at 10.

Within a single score tier the order SHALL be mine to control and SHALL be persisted. The default order for tier members I have never ordered SHALL be alphabetical by title, and those members SHALL appear after any members I have explicitly ordered. Membership of the truncated tier SHALL be expressed by that same tier order: the tier members that fit occupy the remaining slots, in tier order.

The system SHALL provide an edit control in the box's top-right corner whenever any tier has more than one member. The control SHALL open an editor listing every tier of the current list in full — including members of the truncated tier that do not fit — with a cut line marking how many of that tier's members are included. Reordering members within a tier SHALL change their order in the list; moving a member across the cut line SHALL change which members of that tier are included. Saving SHALL persist both, and the persisted order SHALL take precedence over the alphabetical default.

#### Scenario: Ten or more perfect scores
- **WHEN** I have 10 or more anime scored 10
- **THEN** all of them are shown with no cap at 10

#### Scenario: Fewer than ten perfect scores (default fill)
- **WHEN** I have fewer than 10 anime scored 10 and have never ordered the lower tiers
- **THEN** the list is filled up to 10 from the next-highest score tiers, each tier in alphabetical order

#### Scenario: Reordering a tier that exactly fills the list
- **WHEN** I have exactly 10 anime scored 10 and I reorder them in the editor
- **THEN** the top list shows those same 10 anime in my chosen order, and the order is still there after a reload

#### Scenario: Score still dominates order
- **WHEN** I reorder anime across a list containing both 10s and 9s
- **THEN** every anime scored 10 still appears above every anime scored 9, and my ordering only applies within each of those tiers

#### Scenario: Swapping a member of a truncated tier
- **WHEN** a tier has more members than the remaining slots and I move one of its excluded members above the cut line
- **THEN** that anime takes a slot in the top list, the member it displaced drops below the cut line and out of the list, and the change is persisted

#### Scenario: Newly scored anime joins an ordered tier
- **WHEN** I score a new anime into a tier whose order I have already set
- **THEN** it appears after the members I explicitly ordered, alphabetically among any other unordered members of that tier

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: My top anime media-type filter
The system SHALL provide a media-type filter on the "My top anime" box with the options All (default), TV, Movie, OVA, ONA, and Specials. Selecting a type SHALL recompute the top list from only my scored entries of that media type, applying exactly the same rules as the unfiltered list (score tiers descending, all 10s uncapped, fill to a minimum of 10, my persisted tier order, truncated-tier membership by tier order). When a filtered subset has fewer than 10 scored entries the list SHALL show all of them without padding from other media types. The selected filter SHALL be a view control only and SHALL NOT persist across visits to the page; the page SHALL open on All.

#### Scenario: Filtering to a single media type
- **WHEN** I select Movie in the "My top anime" filter
- **THEN** the list shows only my scored movies, ranked by the same score-tier and ordering rules as the unfiltered list

#### Scenario: Filtered subset smaller than ten
- **WHEN** I select a media type for which I have scored fewer than 10 anime
- **THEN** the list shows only those anime and does not pad with anime of other media types

#### Scenario: Filter resets on revisit
- **WHEN** I select a media type, navigate away, and return to the profile page
- **THEN** the filter is back on All

### Requirement: Top-anime ordering is shared across filters
The system SHALL keep one persisted top-anime ordering that every media-type filter view draws from, so ordering an anime once affects both the unfiltered list and any filtered list containing it. Reordering within a filtered view SHALL preserve the relative positions of the same tier's members that the filter hides.

#### Scenario: Order set under a filter shows in the unfiltered list
- **WHEN** I reorder two anime of the same score while the Movie filter is active
- **THEN** switching back to All shows those two anime in that same relative order

#### Scenario: Hidden members keep their positions
- **WHEN** I reorder a tier while a media-type filter hides some of that tier's members
- **THEN** the hidden members keep their positions relative to the visible members that surrounded them
