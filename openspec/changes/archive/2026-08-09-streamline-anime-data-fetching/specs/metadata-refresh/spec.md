## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Visit-triggered live fetches collapse concurrent duplicates
Every read endpoint that can live-fetch from MyAnimeList as a side effect of being visited — the single-anime detail read and the Top Anime ranking read, alongside the season listing that already does this — SHALL admit at most one such fetch per subject at a time. Concurrent requests for the same subject SHALL wait on the in-flight fetch rather than starting a second one.

After acquiring its turn, a waiting request SHALL re-evaluate the condition that triggers the fetch (the row is missing or detail-incomplete; the ranking has not been fetched on the current local day) and SHALL serve the now-updated cache when the condition no longer holds. A subject SHALL be identified by what is being fetched — the anime id, the ranking, the (year, season) pair — so fetches for different subjects still run independently.

A failed fetch SHALL release the turn without marking the subject as fetched, so the next request retries.

#### Scenario: Two overlapping detail reads make one MAL call
- **WHEN** two `GET /api/anime/{id}` requests for the same uncached anime arrive at the same time
- **THEN** one full-detail MAL fetch is made, the second request waits for it and then serves the freshly cached row, and only one set of writes reaches the database

#### Scenario: Two overlapping top-anime reads make one MAL call
- **WHEN** two `GET /api/top-anime` requests arrive at the same time on a day the ranking has not been fetched yet
- **THEN** one ranking fetch is made and both requests are served from its result

#### Scenario: Different anime still fetch in parallel
- **WHEN** detail reads for two different uncached anime arrive at the same time
- **THEN** neither waits on the other, since they are different subjects

#### Scenario: A failed fetch is retried by the next request
- **WHEN** a visit-triggered fetch fails and another request for the same subject arrives afterwards
- **THEN** that request attempts the fetch again rather than being treated as already refreshed

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Full detail fetch reserved for import, tiered refresh, and detail view
The system SHALL only fetch full anime-detail fields (genres, synopsis, background, studio, aired dates, broadcast schedule, related anime) via initial import, the nightly tiered my-list refresh, or the first time that specific anime's own detail page is opened (or its manual refresh action is used) — never as a side effect of a season or Top Anime listing refresh, and never on behalf of an anime the user has not opened. A related anime's media type is reported directly by MAL's `related_anime` data (via nested field selection) as part of that full-detail fetch, so no separate fetch of a related anime is ever made purely to learn its media type.

#### Scenario: Browsing a season does not trigger detail fetches
- **WHEN** the Season or Top Anime listing refreshes
- **THEN** no full anime-detail call is made for any anime in that listing as a result

#### Scenario: Related-anime media types come from the owning anime's own fetch
- **WHEN** an anime's detail page is opened and its full-detail fetch runs
- **THEN** every related anime's media type is resolved from that same fetch, and no additional MAL call is made for any related anime
