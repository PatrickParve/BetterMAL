## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Most rewatched section
The system SHALL show a "Most rewatched" section on the profile page, positioned directly below the "My top anime" box and rendered in the same style as it: a horizontal strip of poster tiles, each tile linking to that anime's detail page and carrying a badge in the same position as the top-anime strip's score badge.

The section SHALL contain every list entry whose rewatch count is greater than zero, regardless of watch status, and SHALL exclude every entry with a rewatch count of zero. The badge on each tile SHALL show that entry's rewatch count.

The strip SHALL be ordered by rewatch count descending. Ties SHALL be broken deterministically: by my score descending (entries with no score last), then alphabetically by title. The strip SHALL NOT be capped at any size — every qualifying entry SHALL be reachable by scrolling the strip to its end.

The section SHALL be read-only: it SHALL NOT offer any reordering control, and its order SHALL be derived entirely from rewatch counts rather than from the persisted top-anime ordering.

#### Scenario: Ordering by rewatch count
- **WHEN** the profile page loads and I have rewatched several anime different numbers of times
- **THEN** the "Most rewatched" strip lists them from most rewatched to least rewatched

#### Scenario: Entries never rewatched are excluded
- **WHEN** an anime on my list has a rewatch count of zero
- **THEN** it does not appear in the "Most rewatched" strip

#### Scenario: Rewatched but not completed
- **WHEN** an anime has a rewatch count above zero and a status other than completed
- **THEN** it still appears in the "Most rewatched" strip

#### Scenario: Breaking a tie
- **WHEN** two anime have the same rewatch count
- **THEN** the higher-scored one appears first, and if neither is scored higher they appear in alphabetical order by title

#### Scenario: Uncapped list scrolls to the end
- **WHEN** I have more rewatched anime than fit across the width of the box
- **THEN** the strip scrolls horizontally and reaches the last of them, with none dropped from the list

#### Scenario: No reorder control
- **WHEN** I look at the "Most rewatched" box
- **THEN** it offers no control for editing the order

#### Scenario: Opening an anime from the strip
- **WHEN** I click a tile in the "Most rewatched" strip
- **THEN** that anime's detail page opens

### Requirement: Most rewatched media-type filter
The system SHALL provide a media-type filter on the "Most rewatched" box with the same options as the "My top anime" filter: All (default), TV, Movie, OVA, ONA, and Specials. Selecting a type SHALL rebuild the strip from only my rewatched entries of that media type, applying the same membership and ordering rules. The Specials option SHALL match both MAL media types the UI treats as specials.

The filter SHALL be a view control only: it SHALL NOT persist across visits to the page, and the section SHALL open on All. The two boxes' filters SHALL be independent, so changing the media type on one box SHALL NOT change the other box's selection or contents.

#### Scenario: Filtering to a single media type
- **WHEN** I select Movie in the "Most rewatched" filter
- **THEN** the strip shows only my rewatched movies, still ordered most rewatched first

#### Scenario: Filters are independent
- **WHEN** I select Movie in the "Most rewatched" filter
- **THEN** the "My top anime" box keeps its own selected filter and contents

#### Scenario: Filter resets on revisit
- **WHEN** I select a media type, navigate away, and return to the profile page
- **THEN** the "Most rewatched" filter is back on All

### Requirement: Most rewatched empty states
The system SHALL show a message in place of the strip whenever the current filter scope has no rewatched anime, worded for that scope: "No shows have been rewatched" under All, "No TV shows have been rewatched" under TV, "No movies have been rewatched" under Movie, "No OVAs have been rewatched" under OVA, "No ONAs have been rewatched" under ONA, and "No specials have been rewatched" under Specials.

#### Scenario: Nothing rewatched at all
- **WHEN** no anime on my list has a rewatch count above zero and the filter is on All
- **THEN** the box shows "No shows have been rewatched"

#### Scenario: Nothing rewatched in one media type
- **WHEN** I select Movie and none of my rewatched anime are movies
- **THEN** the box shows "No movies have been rewatched"

#### Scenario: Empty scope while other scopes have entries
- **WHEN** I have rewatched TV shows but no OVAs and I select OVA
- **THEN** the box shows "No OVAs have been rewatched" rather than falling back to the unfiltered list
