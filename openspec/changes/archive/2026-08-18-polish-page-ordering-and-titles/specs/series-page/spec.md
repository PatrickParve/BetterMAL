## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Series page header
The series page SHALL show the root entry's picture, the series title, a status pill, and the year span of the series (e.g. `2013 – 2023`, or the single year when every entry aired in one year).

The status pill SHALL read `Ongoing` when any member is currently airing **or** when a member has not yet aired, `Upcoming` when no member has finished airing and at least one has not yet aired, and `Finished` otherwise. `Finished` SHALL therefore be reserved for a series with nothing left to come: a series whose aired members have all finished but which has an announced, not-yet-aired member SHALL read `Ongoing`, not `Finished`. The pill SHALL have no `Finished · sequel upcoming` state.

Beside the status pill the page SHALL show a personal badge describing where I stand in the main line, chosen by this precedence:

1. `Completed` — every member of the series has finished airing, at least one main-line entry has finished airing, and every main-line entry that has finished airing is marked Completed in my list.
2. `Caught up` — every main-line entry that has finished airing (if any) is marked Completed in my list, every currently-airing main-line entry has me watching at least as many episodes as it has broadcast so far, and at least one main-line entry has finished airing or is currently airing.
3. `N behind` — the conditions of (2) hold except that currently-airing main-line entries have broadcast episodes I have not watched. N SHALL be the total of those unwatched broadcast episodes across the main line.
4. No badge — when a main-line entry that has finished airing is not marked Completed in my list, or when no main-line entry has finished airing or is currently airing (nothing has aired yet to be caught up on or behind on).

`Caught up` SHALL therefore never be claimed while episodes of a running main-line season sit unwatched. An entry that has not finished airing SHALL count against the badge only to the extent it has actually broadcast — it cannot be completed yet, but the episodes it has already aired are episodes I could have watched. An entry that has not aired at all SHALL NOT count against the badge, and an entry that is not in my list SHALL count as zero episodes watched.

A main line consisting of a single still-running entry — a long-running show that has never split into a "finished" season, such as a long-running weekly series — has no finished-airing entry at all; the "every main-line entry that has finished airing is marked Completed" condition is vacuously satisfied in that case; rather than showing no badge for the entire run, it holds the currently-airing entry itself to the same behind-count check as any other currently-airing main-line entry, so a franchise with only ever one continuous entry can still show `Caught up` or `N behind`.

When a currently-airing main-line entry's broadcast episode count is unknown, the page SHALL show no badge rather than claiming `Caught up` or inventing a behind count, since it cannot tell whether I am current.

#### Scenario: Ongoing series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose latest season is currently airing
- **THEN** the pill reads "Ongoing"

#### Scenario: A series with an announced sequel is ongoing
- **WHEN** every aired member of a series has finished but one member has not yet aired
- **THEN** the pill reads "Ongoing"

#### Scenario: Finished means nothing is left to come
- **WHEN** every member of a series has finished airing and no member is unaired
- **THEN** the pill reads "Finished"

#### Scenario: Year span
- **WHEN** a series' earliest entry aired in 2013 and its latest in 2023
- **THEN** the header shows "2013 – 2023"

#### Scenario: Completed series is badged
- **WHEN** I have marked every main-line entry of a fully finished series as Completed
- **THEN** the header shows a "Completed" badge next to the status pill

#### Scenario: Caught up on an ongoing series
- **WHEN** I have completed every main-line entry that has finished airing, and I have watched all 8 episodes the currently airing season has broadcast so far
- **THEN** the header shows a "Caught up" badge rather than "Completed"

#### Scenario: Behind on an airing season is not "caught up"
- **WHEN** I have completed every main-line entry that has finished airing, and the currently airing season has broadcast 8 episodes of which I have watched 5
- **THEN** the header shows a "3 behind" badge and does not show "Caught up"

#### Scenario: An airing season I have not started at all
- **WHEN** I have completed every earlier main-line entry and the currently airing season, with 8 episodes broadcast, is not in my list
- **THEN** the header shows an "8 behind" badge

#### Scenario: Caught up when the next entry has not aired yet
- **WHEN** every main-line entry that has aired is completed and one main-line entry has not yet aired
- **THEN** the header shows a "Caught up" badge

#### Scenario: Unfinished series is not badged
- **WHEN** one main-line entry that finished airing is not marked Completed in my list
- **THEN** no personal badge is shown

#### Scenario: Behind on a single continuously-airing entry
- **WHEN** a series' main line is a single entry that has never finished airing (no prior season to be "finished"), currently airing, with 1173 episodes broadcast so far of which I have watched 1100
- **THEN** the header shows a "73 behind" badge

#### Scenario: An entirely unaired series is not badged
- **WHEN** no main-line entry has finished airing or is currently airing (every main-line entry is not yet aired)
- **THEN** no personal badge is shown

#### Scenario: Unknown broadcast count shows no badge
- **WHEN** a currently-airing main-line entry has no known count of episodes broadcast so far
- **THEN** no personal badge is shown, rather than "Caught up"

### Requirement: Series score averages
The series page SHALL show, for each of MAL's score and mine, an average across main-line entries and an average across all entries, rendered to two decimals (e.g. `8.42`):

- the MAL average, computed as the unweighted mean of the entries that have a MAL score;
- my average, computed as the unweighted mean of my scores on entries I have scored, where a score of 0 means unscored and is excluded.

Averages SHALL NOT be weighted by episode count, so a movie counts the same as a season. When no entry in a group has a score, the page SHALL show "No score" rather than a zero.

A score chip SHALL show its average and its label and nothing else. It SHALL NOT append the count of entries the average was computed over — the `N of M scored` suffix — to either the MAL chips or my chips, since the per-entry scores it summarises are already listed in full in the watch order below it and the suffix crowds the figure the chip exists to show. The count SHALL NOT reappear as a tooltip, a title attribute, or any other rendered form of the same figure.

When a series has no extras, the two across-all-entries averages SHALL NOT be rendered at all, since they are computed over exactly the same member set as the main-line averages and would duplicate them.

Every MAL average SHALL honour the global hide-scores toggle exactly as MAL scores do elsewhere. An average SHALL be shown in full rather than blurred only when, in this order of precedence:

1. every main-line entry that has finished airing is marked Completed in my list, **and no main-line entry is currently airing** — in which case both MAL averages SHALL be shown, unconditionally; or
2. every entry in that average's group that has finished airing is marked Completed in my list, **and** no member of the series is currently airing.

A member of the series that is currently airing SHALL therefore suppress the reveal of both MAL averages, whether or not I have scored it — unless it's a spin-off/extra airing after the main line has otherwise completely finished, in which case rule 1 still applies. A main-line entry that is itself currently airing always suppresses rule 1, since the main line has not actually finished in that case — only rule 2 can apply, and it will not, since a currently-airing member fails its own "no member of the series is currently airing" condition too. Otherwise the average SHALL remain blurred behind its reveal control.

#### Scenario: Both MAL averages shown
- **WHEN** I open a series with four main-line entries and three extras
- **THEN** the page shows one MAL average over the four main-line entries and one over all seven

#### Scenario: My averages exclude unscored entries
- **WHEN** I have scored three of a series' five main-line entries
- **THEN** my main-series average is the mean of those three scores, with the two unscored entries excluded from it

#### Scenario: No scored-count suffix on any chip
- **WHEN** I open a series page and look at the MAL and Mine score chips
- **THEN** each shows only its label and its average, with no "N of M scored" count appended

#### Scenario: Unscored series
- **WHEN** I have scored none of a series' entries
- **THEN** my averages read "No score" rather than 0.00

#### Scenario: Hidden MAL averages
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on and I have not completed the series
- **THEN** the MAL averages are blurred like every other MAL score, with the value absent from the rendered output

#### Scenario: A series with no extras shows only the main-series averages
- **WHEN** I open a series where every member is main line
- **THEN** the across-all-entries averages are not rendered, and only the main-series MAL and my averages are shown

#### Scenario: An airing main-line member suppresses the reveal
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on, I have completed every main-line entry that has finished airing, and the newest main-line season is currently airing
- **THEN** both MAL averages stay blurred, even though I'm caught up on everything that's aired so far

#### Scenario: Completing the main series always reveals both MAL averages
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on, I have completed every main-line entry that has finished airing, and a spin-off special is currently airing
- **THEN** both the main-series and the across-all-entries MAL averages are shown in full

### Requirement: Series stats
The series page SHALL show, for the main line: total episode count, total runtime, and my progress through it — episodes watched against total, entries completed against total, time watched, and time left to finish. Extras' episode count and runtime SHALL be reported separately rather than folded into the main-line totals.

The entries-completed stat SHALL cover the extras as well as the main line, as two separately labelled figures within one stat: how many main-line entries I have completed out of the main-line total, and how many extras I have completed out of the extras total. The two SHALL NOT be summed into a single figure, so which half of the series is unfinished stays visible. When the series has no extras, the extras figure SHALL be omitted and the stat SHALL show the main-line figure alone rather than an "0 of 0".

Time watched and time left SHALL be shown only while there is time left to watch. When time left computes to zero — I have watched at least as much of the main line as its runtime accounts for — neither stat SHALL be rendered, since "0min left" alongside a time watched that equals the runtime restates what the entries-completed and progress figures already say. Both SHALL be withheld together: the page SHALL NOT show time watched with time left hidden, or the reverse.

This withholding SHALL NOT apply when the main-line runtime is itself unknown — a zero runtime total that the page already marks as unknown rather than as an exact figure. A zero time left derived from a runtime nobody knows reports missing data, not a series I have finished, so both stats SHALL still be shown in that case.

Runtime SHALL be computed as episodes times the entry's average episode duration, falling back to the app's existing 24-minutes-per-episode assumption when a duration is unknown, and SHALL be formatted in days, hours and minutes (e.g. `4d 6h 30min`). When any counted entry's episode count is unknown, the page SHALL mark the total as a lower bound rather than presenting it as exact. An entry whose total episode count is unknown SHALL still contribute its known aired-so-far episode count toward that lower bound, rather than contributing nothing, whenever an aired count is known for it — so a still-airing entry with no announced total makes the lower bound tighter instead of forcing the whole stat to read as wholly unknown. Watched time SHALL count watched episodes only and SHALL NOT multiply by rewatch count.

While any member of the series is currently airing, my progress SHALL be shown with the same broadcast-progress bar the home page uses — episodes aired so far as the primary fill, my watched episodes layered on top of it — so it is visible how much of what has aired I have seen. When no member is airing, my progress SHALL use the plain watched-against-total bar, since aired and total are then the same figure.

The progress figures SHALL be named rather than left to be inferred from a bare `x/y` label: the page SHALL state my watched episode count, the episodes aired so far, and the main-line total as three separately named figures, each keyed to the colour of the fill it describes. The aired figure SHALL be shown only while a member of the series is currently airing, since it is otherwise the same number as the total, and the total SHALL carry its lower-bound marker here exactly as it does in the episode total.

Episodes aired SHALL be summed over exactly those main-line entries whose total episode count is known, counting an entry that has finished airing as its full total, a currently airing entry as the episodes it has aired so far, and an entry that has not yet aired as none — so the aired figure can never exceed the total the page shows.

The page SHALL additionally show the highest MAL-scored entry, my highest-scored entry, and the studios and genres the series spans.

The page SHALL additionally show which entry or entries are tied for the most rewatches across the series (main line and extras alike), naming each tied entry and its rewatch count. This stat SHALL NOT be shown at all when no member of the series has been rewatched, rather than showing a stat naming zero-rewatch entries.

Where several entries tie for the highest MAL score, for my highest score, or for the most rewatches, the page SHALL list every tied entry rather than picking one. Tied highest-MAL entries and tied most-rewatched entries SHALL be listed in watch order. Tied favourites SHALL be listed in my saved favourite order, with entries I have not ordered following in watch order.

The highest MAL score SHALL be shown in full rather than blurred when the entry holding it is one I have both completed and scored, since I already know that score. Until then, the page SHALL withhold that entry's title and link entirely — not only its score — so an unwatched entry is never named by this stat; this withholding applies regardless of the hide-scores toggle's own state, since it protects against spoiling which entry is best rather than against exposing a score value.

#### Scenario: Runtime of the main series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main line totals 62 episodes averaging 24 minutes
- **THEN** the page shows the main-line episode total and a runtime of "1d 0h 48min"

#### Scenario: Extras counted separately
- **WHEN** a series has 5 specials beyond its main line
- **THEN** their episode count and runtime appear as their own figures, not inside the main-line totals

#### Scenario: Unknown episode counts are marked
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with an unpublished total episode count
- **THEN** the runtime total is presented as a lower bound rather than an exact figure

#### Scenario: An unpublished total still counts what has aired
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with no published total episode count but 1,100 episodes are known to have aired for it
- **THEN** the main-line episode total includes those 1,100 aired episodes rather than contributing zero for that entry, and the total is still marked as a lower bound

#### Scenario: My progress through the series
- **WHEN** I have watched 38 of a series' 62 main-line episodes and nothing is airing
- **THEN** the page shows a progress bar with my 38 watched episodes and the 62 total each named, how many entries I have completed, my time watched, and the time left to finish

#### Scenario: Entries completed covers extras too
- **WHEN** I open a series where I have completed 5 of 6 main-line entries and 2 of its 3 extras
- **THEN** the entries-completed stat shows "5 of 6" for the main line and "2 of 3" for the extras as two labelled figures, rather than one combined "7 of 9"

#### Scenario: A series with no extras shows one figure
- **WHEN** I open a series whose every member is main line
- **THEN** the entries-completed stat shows only the main-line figure, with no extras figure beside it

#### Scenario: A finished series hides the time stats
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main line I have watched in full, so no time is left
- **THEN** neither "Time left" nor "Time watched" is shown

#### Scenario: A part-watched series keeps both time stats
- **WHEN** I open a series with main-line episodes I have not yet watched
- **THEN** both "Time watched" and "Time left" are shown

#### Scenario: An unknown runtime is not mistaken for a finished series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main-line runtime total is unknown, so it reports zero time left without my having watched it through
- **THEN** both "Time watched" and "Time left" are still shown, because the zero reflects a runtime nobody knows rather than a series I have finished

#### Scenario: Broadcast progress while a season is airing
- **WHEN** a series' latest season is currently airing, 12 of its episodes have aired, and earlier seasons total 50 episodes
- **THEN** my progress shows a bar whose aired fill covers 62 episodes with my watched episodes layered on top of it, and the watched, aired, and total figures are each named beside it

#### Scenario: The aired figure is only shown while something is airing
- **WHEN** I open a series where no member is currently airing
- **THEN** the progress readout names my watched count and the total, and does not repeat the total as a separate aired figure

#### Scenario: Tied highest MAL scores list every entry
- **WHEN** two seasons of a series share the same highest MAL score
- **THEN** both are listed under the highest MAL score, in watch order

#### Scenario: Highest MAL score of a completed entry is not blurred
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on and the highest-MAL-scored entry is one I have completed and scored
- **THEN** its MAL score is shown in full

#### Scenario: An unwatched entry's title is withheld from Highest MAL score
- **WHEN** the entry holding the series' highest MAL score is not one I have both completed and scored
- **THEN** the page shows no title or link for that entry in the Highest MAL score stat, regardless of whether the hide-scores toggle is on or off

#### Scenario: Tied favourites list every entry
- **WHEN** I have given the same highest score to three entries of a series
- **THEN** all three are listed as my favourite

#### Scenario: Most rewatched entry is shown
- **WHEN** one entry in a series has a rewatch count of 3 and no other member has a higher rewatch count
- **THEN** the page shows a "Most rewatched" stat naming that entry and its count of 3

#### Scenario: Tied most-rewatched entries list every entry
- **WHEN** two entries in a series share the same highest rewatch count
- **THEN** both are listed under "Most rewatched", in watch order

#### Scenario: No rewatch stat when nothing has been rewatched
- **WHEN** no member of a series has a rewatch count above zero
- **THEN** the page shows no "Most rewatched" stat at all
