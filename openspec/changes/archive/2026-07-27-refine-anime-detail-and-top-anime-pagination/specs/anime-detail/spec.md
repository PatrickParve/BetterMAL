## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Single anime detail layout
The system SHALL show a single anime page with the title and a large picture on the left, and near the top-right of the title two separate side-by-side boxes: one showing rank and MAL score (MAL score respecting the hide/unhide toggle), and one showing my score and rewatch count. Below those it SHALL show an info box (type, status, source, duration, studio, aired-from/to, and genres) and, beneath it, a synopsis/background box. Any info field for which no data is available SHALL display "No info" rather than being blank.

The info box's Status field SHALL, when the anime is currently airing and an aired-episode count is known, read `Currently airing: <aired>/<total> ep aired`, using `?` in place of an unknown total episode count. When the anime is currently airing but no aired-episode count can be determined, the field SHALL read `Currently airing` with no counts appended. Statuses other than currently airing SHALL be displayed unchanged.

#### Scenario: Rendering the detail layout
- **WHEN** I open an anime's detail page
- **THEN** it shows the title with a large picture on the left, a "rank and MAL score" box and a separate "my score and rewatch count" box side by side, an info box (type, status, source, duration, studio, aired-from/to, genres), and a synopsis/background box

#### Scenario: MAL score respects the hide toggle
- **WHEN** the hide toggle is on
- **THEN** the MAL score in the rank/score box is blurred like everywhere else it appears

#### Scenario: Missing info field
- **WHEN** an info field (e.g. source or duration) has no data for that anime
- **THEN** that field shows "No info" instead of a blank value

#### Scenario: Currently airing with a known episode count
- **WHEN** I open the detail page of an anime that is currently airing, has 12 total episodes, and has had 5 episodes air so far
- **THEN** the Status field reads "Currently airing: 5/12 ep aired"

#### Scenario: Currently airing with an unknown total
- **WHEN** I open the detail page of a currently airing anime whose total episode count is unpublished and that has had 5 episodes air so far
- **THEN** the Status field reads "Currently airing: 5/? ep aired"

#### Scenario: Currently airing with no derivable aired count
- **WHEN** I open the detail page of a currently airing anime for which no aired-episode count can be derived
- **THEN** the Status field reads "Currently airing" with no episode counts appended

#### Scenario: Other airing statuses unaffected
- **WHEN** I open the detail page of an anime that has finished airing or has not yet aired
- **THEN** the Status field reads "Finished airing" or "Not yet aired" respectively, with no episode counts appended
