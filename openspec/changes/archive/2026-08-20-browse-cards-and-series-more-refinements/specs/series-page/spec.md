## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Series composition from the relation graph
The system SHALL derive a series as the connected component of the stored related-anime graph, traversing only story relations: `sequel`, `prequel`, `side_story`, `parent_story`, `summary`, `full_story`, `spin_off`, and `alternative_version`. Every other relation MAL reports — including `alternative_setting`, `character`, and any unrecognized relation string — SHALL be stored as it already is but SHALL NOT be traversed, so shows that merely share a universe or a cast never merge into one series.

The `other` relation SHALL be traversed in exactly one case: when precisely one of its two ends is an anime whose media type is `music`. MAL links a franchise's opening/ending/image songs to the show they belong to with `other` and nothing else, so a franchise's music entries are otherwise unreachable — they either vanish from the series entirely or form their own music-only series. A music end SHALL be recognised only from an already-cached media type: an `other` relation whose far end has no cached metadata row SHALL NOT be traversed and SHALL NOT spend fetch budget, since the system cannot tell a song from a commercial without fetching, and `other` also links commercials, promos, and crossovers.

`other` relations where neither end is a music entry, and where both ends are music entries, SHALL NOT be traversed. Because the rule is stated over the relation's two ends rather than over the direction it is stored in, a series built from the song and a series built from the show SHALL produce the same component.

Traversal SHALL be undirected: from a member the system SHALL follow both that anime's own relation rows and relation rows pointing at it, so a member whose own relations have never been fetched still connects the component.

An anime SHALL belong to at most one series.

Every series stored under the previous traversal rules SHALL be rebuilt once, on its next read, so a franchise's music entries join it without the user having to request a rebuild.

#### Scenario: Sequels and prequels form one series
- **WHEN** a series is built from an anime whose relations chain through two sequels and one prequel
- **THEN** all four anime are members of the same series

#### Scenario: Alternative-setting relations do not merge series
- **WHEN** an anime is related to another only by `alternative_setting` or `character`
- **THEN** the other anime is not a member of its series

#### Scenario: Reverse edges keep the component connected
- **WHEN** anime A stores a `sequel` relation to anime B, and B has never been full-fetched and stores no relations of its own
- **THEN** B is still a member of A's series

#### Scenario: A franchise's song joins the franchise
- **WHEN** a TV series stores an `other` relation to a `music` entry — its opening theme's music video — and that entry has a cached metadata row
- **THEN** the music entry is a member of that series

#### Scenario: The song's own series is the show's series
- **WHEN** a series is built starting from that music entry instead of from the show
- **THEN** the same component is produced, with the show and its seasons as members, rather than a music-only series

#### Scenario: A music-only series is absorbed
- **WHEN** a music entry and its cover version are stored as their own two-member series, and the franchise the song belongs to is rebuilt under these rules
- **THEN** both are members of the franchise's series and the music-only series no longer exists

#### Scenario: Non-music `other` relations still do not merge series
- **WHEN** a show stores an `other` relation to a commercial, a promotional video, or a crossover short
- **THEN** that anime is not pulled into the show's series

#### Scenario: An uncached `other` end costs nothing
- **WHEN** a member stores an `other` relation to an anime with no cached metadata row
- **THEN** the relation is not traversed, no MAL fetch is spent on it, and the build is not marked partial on its account

### Requirement: Series stats
The series page SHALL show, for the main line: total episode count, total runtime, and my progress through it — episodes watched against total, entries completed against total, time watched, and time left to finish. Extras' episode count and runtime SHALL be reported separately rather than folded into the main-line totals.

The entries-completed stat SHALL cover the extras as well as the main line, as two separately labelled figures within one stat: how many main-line entries I have completed out of the main-line total, and how many extras I have completed out of the extras total. The two SHALL NOT be summed into a single figure, so which half of the series is unfinished stays visible. When the series has no extras, the extras figure SHALL be omitted and the stat SHALL show the main-line figure alone rather than an "0 of 0".

Time watched and time left SHALL be shown only while there is time left to watch. When time left computes to zero — I have watched at least as much of the main line as its runtime accounts for — neither stat SHALL be rendered, since "0min left" alongside a time watched that equals the runtime restates what the entries-completed and progress figures already say. Both SHALL be withheld together: the page SHALL NOT show time watched with time left hidden, or the reverse.

This withholding SHALL NOT apply when the main-line runtime is itself unknown — a zero runtime total that the page already marks as unknown rather than as an exact figure. A zero time left derived from a runtime nobody knows reports missing data, not a series I have finished, so both stats SHALL still be shown in that case.

Runtime SHALL be computed as episodes times the entry's average episode duration, falling back to the app's existing 24-minutes-per-episode assumption when a duration is unknown, and SHALL be formatted in days, hours and minutes (e.g. `4d 6h 30min`). When any counted entry's episode count is unknown, the page SHALL mark the total as a lower bound rather than presenting it as exact. An entry whose total episode count is unknown SHALL still contribute its known aired-so-far episode count toward that lower bound, rather than contributing nothing, whenever an aired count is known for it — so a still-airing entry with no announced total makes the lower bound tighter instead of forcing the whole stat to read as wholly unknown. Watched time SHALL count watched episodes only and SHALL NOT multiply by rewatch count.

While any member of the series is currently airing, my progress SHALL be shown with the same broadcast-progress bar the home page uses — episodes aired so far as the primary fill, my watched episodes layered on top of it — so it is visible how much of what has aired I have seen. When no member is airing, my progress SHALL use the plain watched-against-total bar, since aired and total are then the same figure.

The progress figures SHALL be named rather than left to be inferred from a bare `x/y` label: the page SHALL state my watched episode count, the episodes aired so far, and the main-line total as three separately named figures, each keyed to the colour of the fill it describes. The aired figure SHALL be shown only while a member of the series is currently airing, since it is otherwise the same number as the total, and the total SHALL carry its lower-bound marker here exactly as it does in the episode total.

Episodes aired SHALL be summed over exactly those main-line entries whose total episode count is known, counting an entry that has finished airing as its full total, a currently airing entry as the episodes it has aired so far, and an entry that has not yet aired as none — so the aired figure can never exceed the total the page shows.

The page SHALL additionally show the highest MAL-scored entry, my highest-scored entry, and the studios and genres the series spans.

The page SHALL additionally show which entry or entries are tied for the most rewatches across the series (main line and extras alike), naming each tied entry and its rewatch count. This stat SHALL NOT be shown at all when no member of the series has been rewatched, rather than showing a stat naming zero-rewatch entries.

Where several entries tie for the highest MAL score, for my highest score, or for the most rewatches, the page SHALL list every tied entry rather than picking one. Tied highest-MAL entries and tied most-rewatched entries SHALL be listed in watch order. Tied favourites SHALL be listed in my saved favourite order, with entries I have not ordered following in watch order.

The highest MAL score SHALL be shown in full rather than blurred when the entry holding it is one I have marked **Completed** or **Dropped** in my list. Both statuses settle my relationship with that entry — dropping a show is as much a decision about it as finishing one — so neither leaves a viewing ahead of me that naming the series' best entry could spoil. My having scored that entry SHALL NOT be required: a dropped entry frequently carries no score of mine, and withholding the stat until one exists would hide it indefinitely. Until the entry reaches one of those two statuses, the page SHALL withhold that entry's title and link entirely — not only its score — so an entry I have not settled is never named by this stat; this withholding applies regardless of the hide-scores toggle's own state, since it protects against spoiling which entry is best rather than against exposing a score value.

#### Scenario: Runtime of the main series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main line totals 62 episodes averaging 24 minutes
- **THEN** the page shows the main-line episode total and a runtime of "1d 0h 48min"

#### Scenario: Extras counted separately
- **WHEN** a series has 5 specials beyond its main line
- **THEN** their episode count and runtime appear as their own figures, not inside the main-line totals

#### Scenario: Unknown episode counts are marked
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with an unpublished total episode count
- **THEN** the runtime total is presented as a lower bound rather than an exact figure

#### Scenario: An unpublished total still counts what has aired
- **WHEN** a main-line entry is currently airing with no published total episode count but 1,100 episodes are known to have aired for it
- **THEN** the main-line episode total includes those 1,100 aired episodes rather than contributing zero for that entry, and the total is still marked as a lower bound

#### Scenario: My progress through the series
- **WHEN** I have watched 38 of a series' 62 main-line episodes and nothing is airing
- **THEN** the page shows a progress bar with my 38 watched episodes and the 62 total each named, how many entries I have completed, my time watched, and the time left to finish

#### Scenario: Entries completed covers extras too
- **WHEN** I open a series where I have completed 5 of 6 main-line entries and 2 of its 3 extras
- **THEN** the entries-completed stat shows "5 of 6" for the main line and "2 of 3" for the extras as two labelled figures, rather than one combined "7 of 9"

#### Scenario: A series with no extras shows one figure
- **WHEN** I open a series whose every member is main line
- **THEN** the entries-completed stat shows only the main-line figure, with no extras figure beside it

#### Scenario: A finished series hides the time stats
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main line I have watched in full, so no time is left
- **THEN** neither "Time left" nor "Time watched" is shown

#### Scenario: A part-watched series keeps both time stats
- **WHEN** I open a series with main-line episodes I have not yet watched
- **THEN** both "Time watched" and "Time left" are shown

#### Scenario: An unknown runtime is not mistaken for a finished series
- **WHEN** I open a series whose main-line runtime total is unknown, so it reports zero time left without my having watched it through
- **THEN** both "Time watched" and "Time left" are still shown, because the zero reflects a runtime nobody knows rather than a series I have finished

#### Scenario: Broadcast progress while a season is airing
- **WHEN** a series' latest season is currently airing, 12 of its episodes have aired, and earlier seasons total 50 episodes
- **THEN** my progress shows a bar whose aired fill covers 62 episodes with my watched episodes layered on top of it, and the watched, aired, and total figures are each named beside it

#### Scenario: The aired figure is only shown while something is airing
- **WHEN** I open a series where no member is currently airing
- **THEN** the progress readout names my watched count and the total, and does not repeat the total as a separate aired figure

#### Scenario: Tied highest MAL scores list every entry
- **WHEN** two seasons of a series share the same highest MAL score
- **THEN** both are listed under the highest MAL score, in watch order

#### Scenario: Highest MAL score of a completed entry is not blurred
- **WHEN** the hide-scores toggle is on and the highest-MAL-scored entry is one I have completed
- **THEN** its title, link, and MAL score are shown in full

#### Scenario: Highest MAL score of a dropped entry is shown
- **WHEN** the highest-MAL-scored entry of a series is one I have marked Dropped, and I never gave it a score of my own
- **THEN** the stat names that entry, links to it, and shows its MAL score, exactly as it would for a completed entry

#### Scenario: An unsettled entry's title is withheld from Highest MAL score
- **WHEN** the entry holding the series' highest MAL score is one I am Watching, have On-hold, Plan to watch, or do not have in my list at all
- **THEN** the page shows no title or link for that entry in the Highest MAL score stat, regardless of whether the hide-scores toggle is on or off

#### Scenario: Tied favourites list every entry
- **WHEN** I have given the same highest score to three entries of a series
- **THEN** all three are listed as my favourite

#### Scenario: Most rewatched entry is shown
- **WHEN** one entry in a series has a rewatch count of 3 and no other member has a higher rewatch count
- **THEN** the page shows a "Most rewatched" stat naming that entry and its count of 3

#### Scenario: Tied most-rewatched entries list every entry
- **WHEN** two entries in a series share the same highest rewatch count
- **THEN** both are listed under "Most rewatched", in watch order

#### Scenario: No rewatch stat when nothing has been rewatched
- **WHEN** no member of a series has a rewatch count above zero
- **THEN** the page shows no "Most rewatched" stat at all

### Requirement: Main series and More sections
The main line's presentation SHALL be governed by the Series timeline ribbon requirement, not by this one; this requirement governs only the More section, where extras SHALL be presented as poster tiles grouped by media type, so the extras read as a different kind of thing from the chronological main line.

Each tile SHALL carry the information a main-line card carries — picture, title, media type, year, episode count, MAL score, my score, and my list status — SHALL link to that anime's detail page, SHALL offer the same edit control, and SHALL show its entry's rewatch count when it is greater than zero. As on a main-line card, a tile's title SHALL reserve the same vertical space regardless of line count, so tiles in the same row stay aligned.

Each of a tile's secondary text lines — the media type/year/episode count line, and the aired-progress line when it is shown — SHALL occupy exactly one line whatever its content, truncating with an ellipsis rather than wrapping, so no tile is made taller than its row neighbours by the length of its own text. The grid SHALL size its columns so that a tile whose picture is portrait is wide enough to show that meta line in full for the ordinary worst case — a two-word media type such as `TV special`, a four-digit year, and a two-digit episode count — so an extra's episode count is not the part that gets truncated away. Ellipsis truncation remains the backstop for longer content, not the normal outcome.

Each More group SHALL show its entry count in its heading.

The More section SHALL offer two controls: an "in my list" filter and an expand/collapse-all control. Which extras are visible SHALL be governed by those controls alone — the section SHALL NOT force any extra to stay visible on the user's behalf, whatever its status or progress, and SHALL NOT vary its initial state with how many extras the series has.

The "in my list" filter SHALL be on when a series page is opened: every group renders expanded, showing only the extras that are in my list — whatever their status: Watching, Completed, On hold, Plan to watch, or Dropped alike — and hiding every extra that is not in my list. It SHALL be a two-state control that reports which state it is in. Turning it on SHALL restore that filtered view; turning it off SHALL show every extra.

The expand/collapse-all control SHALL read "Expand" while anything is hidden — whether by the filter, by a collapsed group, or by both — and activating it SHALL show every extra of every group, turning the filter off. Once every extra is shown it SHALL read "Collapse", and activating it SHALL collapse every group so that no tile is rendered at all, including the extras in my list. It SHALL read "Expand all"/"Collapse all" when the series has more than one More group, and "Expand"/"Collapse" without the word "all" when it has exactly one group, since "all" is meaningless applied to a single category.

Both controls SHALL always be offered while the series has extras, whatever my statuses across them.

Each More group SHALL additionally be collapsible on its own, and a collapsed group SHALL NOT render its tiles, so a franchise with many extras cannot make the page arbitrarily long. A group showing fewer tiles than its entry count SHALL offer a control naming how many are hidden, which reveals that group's remaining tiles without changing what any other group shows.

An edit saved from a tile SHALL update it in place without reloading the page.

#### Scenario: Extras grouped in More
- **WHEN** a series has two specials, one OVA, and a music video
- **THEN** the More section shows them as poster tiles under a collapsible group per media type, each heading carrying its count

#### Scenario: A tile's episode count is not truncated away
- **WHEN** a portrait-pictured extra is a `TV special` that aired in 2003 and has 99 episodes
- **THEN** its tile shows `TV special · 2003 · 99 ep` in full at the grid's narrowest column width

#### Scenario: A long meta line stays on one line
- **WHEN** a tile's media type, year, and episode count are longer still than that worst case
- **THEN** the line truncates with an ellipsis on one line, and the tile's score chips and footer stay aligned with the other tiles in its row

#### Scenario: Opening a series shows only my own extras
- **WHEN** I open a series with twenty extras, four of which are in my list — one Watching, one Completed, one Dropped, one Plan to watch
- **THEN** every group is expanded showing only those four tiles, the sixteen extras not in my list are hidden, and the all-groups control reads "Expand all"

#### Scenario: Expanding shows everything
- **WHEN** I activate the all-groups control from that state
- **THEN** all twenty extras are shown, the "in my list" filter reads as off, and the control now reads "Collapse all"

#### Scenario: Collapsing hides my own extras too
- **WHEN** every extra is shown and I activate the "Collapse all" control
- **THEN** no tiles are rendered in any group, including the extras in my list, and the control reads "Expand all" again

#### Scenario: Filtering back to my list
- **WHEN** every extra is shown and I turn the "in my list" filter on
- **THEN** each group shows only its extras that are in my list, and the all-groups control reads "Expand all"

#### Scenario: A group with nothing of mine in it
- **WHEN** the filter is on and a group holds no extras that are in my list
- **THEN** that group shows its heading and entry count with no tiles, and offers a control naming how many are hidden

#### Scenario: Revealing one group's hidden extras
- **WHEN** I activate that group's hidden-count control
- **THEN** that group shows all of its tiles while every other group keeps showing only my own extras

#### Scenario: Controls are offered whatever my statuses
- **WHEN** every extra in a series is marked Completed in my list
- **THEN** the "in my list" filter and the all-groups control are both still offered, and collapsing hides those completed extras

#### Scenario: A large More section is not treated differently
- **WHEN** I open a series with twenty extras and one with four extras
- **THEN** both open with their groups expanded and filtered to the extras in my list, rather than one of them starting collapsed

#### Scenario: Editing from a tile
- **WHEN** I use a tile's edit control and save a new score
- **THEN** the same entry editor used elsewhere in the app opens, and the tile and the series stats reflect the new score without a page reload

#### Scenario: An extra added to my list from its tile stays visible
- **WHEN** the filter is on, I add an extra to my list from a revealed tile, and the section re-renders
- **THEN** that extra is now one of the tiles the filter keeps

#### Scenario: A series with no extras
- **WHEN** every member of a series is main line
- **THEN** the More section is not shown

#### Scenario: Singular wording for one extras category
- **WHEN** a series has extras in only one media-type group
- **THEN** the all-groups control reads "Expand" or "Collapse" without the word "all"

#### Scenario: Plural wording for more than one extras category
- **WHEN** a series has extras across two or more media-type groups
- **THEN** the all-groups control reads "Expand all" or "Collapse all"

#### Scenario: A rewatched extra shows its count
- **WHEN** an extra has a rewatch count of 1
- **THEN** its tile shows a rewatch indicator reading 1
